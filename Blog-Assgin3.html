        A computer mouse is a handheld hardware input device that controls a cursor in a GUI 
        (graphical user interface) for pointing, moving and selecting text, icons, files, and 
        folders on your computer. In addition to these functions, a mouse can also be used to 
        drag-and-drop objects and give you access to the right-click menu.
        For desktop computers, the mouse is placed on a flat surface (e.g., mouse pad or desk) in front of 
        your computer. The picture is an example of a Logitech desktop computer mouse with two primary buttons
        and a wheel.

    <h2 class="h2">&#x2B50Who invented the mouse?</h2>
    <p class="para1">
        The mouse was initially known as the X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System and was invented by 
        Douglas Engelbart in 1963 while working at Xerox PARC. But, due to Alto's lack of success, 
        the first widely used application of the mouse was with the Apple Lisa computer. Today,
        this pointing device is on virtually every computer.

    <h2 class="h3">&#x2B50;What are the uses of a mouse?</h2>
    <p class="para2">
        Below is a list of all the computer mouse functions and options to give you an idea of 
        all the mouse capabilities.
        <ol class="list">
            <li><b>Move the mouse cursor</b> - The primary function is to move the mouse pointer 
                on the screen.</li>
            <li><b>Point</b> - Once the mouse is moved, you can point something out for another user or point 
                a digital object. For example, in a game you can use the mouse to point a gun in the direction
                 to shoot.</li>    
                 li><b>Open or execute a program </b> - Once you've moved the pointer to an icon, folder, or another 
                 object clicking or double-clicking that object opens the document or executes the program. 
                 Some programs even support tripple-clicking. See our click page for further information on 
                 mouse clicking.</li> 
                 <li><b>Select </b> - O A mouse also allows you to select text or a file or highlight and select
                  multiple files at once.</li> 
                 <li><b>Drag-and-drop  </b> - OnOnce something is selected, it can also be moved using 
                 the drag-and-drop method..</li> 
                 <li><b>Hover</b> - OnMoving the mouse cursor over objects with hover information helps 
                 discover each object's function. For example, hover the mouse over the "hover" link to
                  see an example.</li> 
                  <li><b>Scroll</b> -When working with a long document or viewing a long web page,
                   you may need to scroll up or down. To scroll, rotate the mouse wheel, 
                   or click-and-drag the scroll bar. The mouse wheel can also be used as a
                    button. See the IntelliMouse page for further information and functions of 
                    the mouse wheel.</li>

            <td>Wired Mouse</td>
            <td>The pointer or cursor on a display screen is operated by a mouse. A mouse can roll over 
                a flat surface, hard is a small object. The name derives from its shape, a bit like a mouse, 
                the wire that you can imagine to be the tail of the mouse, and the fact that you will scurry 
                along a floor. The display pointer moves in the same direction when you move the mouse.</td>

            <td> Optical Mouse</td>
            <td> It is the mouse that lifts Joe, you see everywhere today. Nevertheless, an optical mouse
                 uses an LED, sensing changes to the reflected light and detecting the movement rather 
                 using a ball of rubbers and mechanical sensors. No sweet rubber balls to cleanse. 
                 Nevertheless, the optical mouse does not completely stay physically stable when light 
                 is being used in monitoring movements, but the buttons and scroll wheel are still 
                 mechanical and can be worn over time.</td>

            <td>  Laser Mouse</td>
            <td>The laser mouse is an optical mouse type, and the operating instructions are similar –
                 to sense movement through light reflection. Nevertheless, a laser mouse uses an LED 
                 instead of a laser beam, as the name implies. Due to the different light characteristics,
                  the mouse can primarily be used on glass and plastic surfaces, 
                  although it is not effective.</td>

                While a standard mouse typically has only 3 buttons, a game mouse has several buttons and 
                is precise. Such additional buttons are also programmable to do various tasks … particularly
                 for gaming purposes. Scheduling keys, useful also for non-gaming purposes. They can, 
                 for example, be used for web browsing or video replay as forward and backward buttons.
