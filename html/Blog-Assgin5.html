        Alternatively referred to as main memory, primary memory, or system memory, RAM (random-access memory)
         is a hardware device that allows information to be stored and retrieved on a computer. RAM is usually
          associated with DRAM, which is a type of memory module. Because data is accessed randomly instead of 
          sequentially like it is on a CD or hard drive, access times are much faster. However, unlike ROM,
           RAM is a volatile memory and requires power to keep the data accessible. If the computer is turned 
           off, all data contained in RAM is lost.

       As the computer boots, parts of the operating system and drivers are loaded into memory,
       which allows the CPU to process instructions faster and speed up the boot process. After 
       the operating system is loaded, programs you open like the browser you're using to view this page
       are also loaded into memory. If too many programs are open, the computer swaps the data
       in the memory between the RAM and the hard disk drive.
       A computer's performance is largely attributed to the amount of memory contained within it.
       If a computer does not have the recommended memory to run the operating system and its programs, 
       it results in slower performance. The more memory a computer has, the more information and software
       it can load and process quickly.

    <h2 class="h3">&#x2B50;Types of RAM:</h2>
    <p class="para2">
        Over the evolution of the computer, there have been different variations of RAM. Some of the more 
        common examples are DIMM, RIMM, SIMM, SO-DIMM, and SOO-RIMM. Below is an example image of a 512 MB 
        DIMM computer memory module, a piece of RAM found in older desktop computers. This memory module 
        would be installed into one of the memory slots on a motherboard.

        He first form of RAM came about in 1947 with the use of the Williams tube. It utilized a CRT
         (cathode ray tube); the data was stored on the face as electrically charged spots.
        The second widely used form of RAM was magnetic-core memory, invented in 1947. Frederick Viehe 
        is credited with much of the work, having filed for several patents relating to the design. 
        Magnetic-core memory works through the use of tiny metal rings and wires connecting to each ring. 
        One bit of data could be stored per ring and accessed at any time.
        However, RAM, as we know it today, as solid-state memory, was first invented in 1968 by Robert 
        Dennard. Known specifically as dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, transistors were used to 
        store bits of data.
