    <h1 class="hd1">&#x1F449;What is website?</h1>
    <p class="para1">
        A website is a collection of webpages that all share the same domain name.
        These webpages often include features such as photographs, videos, and text and are used to present
        information about the company or group.<br> To visit a website, users need a device with a
        web browser — computers, smartphones, or tablets — as well as an Internet connection.<br>
        Once users have those, they may visit the website by typing the website's address into the address bar
        of their device's web browser.

     <h1 class="hd2">&#x1F449;What Websites Are Used For:</h1>
     <p class="para2">Before we learn how websites work, let’s explore what websites are used for.Websites 
         are built for different purposes or goals. Some reasons for putting up a website include:
         <ul class="ulist">
             <li><b>Providing information: Multiple websites exist to provide information. For example, government
                  and business websites inform visitors of updates in their respective offices or companies, 
                  while news websites update users on the latest happenings around the world.</b>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <b>Entertaining: Websites such as YouTube and Netflix allow you to watch movies and shows, listen
                to music or play games</b>
            </li><br>
            <li>
               <b> Interacting with other users: Social networking sites and forums allow users to connect, 
                communicate and share ideas.</b>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <b>Buying and selling items: E-commerce websites like Amazon and eBay allow users to sell and 
                purchase items online.</b>
            </li><br>
            <li>
                <b>Showcasing work: Personal and portfolio websites are sites created to demonstrate a person’s
                ability by collecting and showing past projects they’ve worked on for future clients.</b>
            </li>
         </ul>

        <h1 class="hd3">&#x1F449;What You Need To Start a Website:</h1>
        <p class="para3">
            Websites are made of a set of code or programming languages. The most common languages used to 
            build websites are:<br><br>
            To start a website, you will need the following:

                <p class="par">Websites are made of a set of code or programming languages. The most common languages 
                   used to build websites are:
                <ul class="ul1">
                    <li><b>Hypertext markup language (HTML) helps browsers display webpage elements such as text,
                        links and media.</b></li><br>
                    <li>
                       <b> Cascading style sheets (CSS) define webpage styles such as colors, layouts and fonts.</b>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                       <b> Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) is the programming language used to create dynamic and 
                        interactive websites. PHP is responsible for retrieving content from databases and 
                        displaying them on your website. With PHP, you can create login pages, forms and 
                        galleries.</b>
                    </li><br>
                    <li>
                        <b>JavaScript allows you to implement complex features to your website. Anytime your 
                        website does more than display static information, JavaScript is probably involved.</b>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p class="par1">
                    Nowadays, you don’t have to build websites straight from code. Content management systems 
                    (CMS) such as WordPress, Drupal and Joomla allow you to build a website easily.These platforms
                    use code but do not require users to have developer-level coding skills to use them.
                    WordPress, which powers over 40% of the internet, is the most popular option. It provides a 
                    user-friendly interface that empowers everyone to build websites with minimal tech knowledge.
                </p>
                 <li class="ol2"> <h5>&#x2B50;Web Hosting:</h5></li>
                 <p class="par2">Websites are made up of different files needed to display your content online.
                    How would you get these files from your computer to the internet — and where would you store
                    them?<br><br>The answer — web servers and web hosting.<br><br>After choosing a platform to build your 
                    website, you’ll need a web host, which serves and stores your website files on an online
                    space called the webserver.<br><br>
                    Your host transfers all the files needed to fulfill that request whenever someone visits 
                    your website. Web hosts also help you with backups, uptime and security maintenance.<br><br>
                    Free website building platforms such as WordPress often require you to sign up for 
                    web hosting separately.<br><br>
                    An advantage of using these free CMS is complete control over your website, which is 
                    good until you realize that you’re also responsible for the not-so-fun parts 
                    like website security and maintenance.<br><br>
                    If you want a platform that takes care of everything from web hosting to security, you can
                    opt for website builders like Bluehost’s Website Builder.</p>
                    <li class="ol3"> <h5>&#x2B50;A Domain Name:</h5></li>
                    <p class="par3">Lastly, you’ll need a domain name to make your website work.<br>
                     A domain name is the website name users enter on the browser (i.e., Chrome, Firefox 
                     or Safari) when they visit your website.<br><br>
                     Computers, servers, and other devices connected over the internet are each assigned a unique 
                     string of numbers called the internet protocol (IP) address.<br><br>
                     Every time you access a website, your computer communicates to the website’s server 
                     through IP addresses. But because the IP address consists of multiple numbers, users
                    would struggle to memorize which string of numbers belongs to a website.<br><br>
                    Thus, the domain name system (DNS) was born.
                    The DNS is composed of multiple nameservers that look up the domain. You can think of the 
                    DNS as a large address book where computers can look up domain names and match them to
                    their corresponding IP address.<br><br>
                    You can sign up for a domain name via domain name registrars or get one for free when you 
                    sign up for a web hosting plan.<br><br>
                    Now that you know what you need to start a website, let’s see how these elements work 
                    together as we explore how websites work.
                    Let’s go back to the scenario where your website visitor types your domain name into their
                    web browser.
                    </p>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h1 class="hd4">&#x1F449;How Do Websites Work?</h1>
        <p class="para4">
            Once a visitor types your domain name into their browser’s address bar, their computer sends a 
            request to connect to the webserver keeping your files. Before reaching the web server, the 
            request passes through the DNS, which looks up the server’s IP address.<br><br>
            The DNS ensures that the browser connects to the correct server.<br><br>
            Once everything checks out, the server processes the files your website needs to display its
            content.<br><br>
            The web browser ‘reads’ those files (HTML, CSS, images and others) and displays them on the 
            visitor’s screen.<br><br>
            And that’s how websites work.<br><br>
            These processes happen in a few seconds — ideally, two to five seconds is the preferred page load 
            speed.

        <h1 class="hd5">&#x1F449;Why You Need a Website?</h1>

            If you don’t have a website yet, this is your sign to get one.<br><br>

                        rising. It has always been in the future of retail; the pandemic only sped up its 
                        adoption.</p>

                       <b>&#x2B50;You’ll appear more credible. Customers will often check reviews and recommendations
