        A computer is a programmable device that stores, retrieves, and processes data. The term "computer"
         was originally given to humans (human computers) who performed numerical calculations using 
         mechanical calculators, such as the abacus and slide rule. The term was later given to mechanical 
         devices as they began replacing human computers. Today's computers are electronic devices that 
         accept data (input), process that data, produce output, and store (storage) the results (IPOS).

    <p class="para1">
        Below is a picture of a computer with each of the main components. You can see the desktop computer,
         flat-panel display, speakers, keyboard, and mouse in the picture below. We've also labeled each of 
         the input devices and output devices.

    <h2 class="h3">&#x2B50;Types of computers:</h2>
    <p class="para2">
        Computers can be classified as one of three types of computers: a general-purpose computer, 
        special-purpose computer, or specialized computer.
        A general-purpose computer is what most people think of when thinking about a computer and is what 
        this page covers.
        A special-purpose computer is embedded in almost all electronic devices and is the most widely-used
        computer. This computer is designed for a specific task and is found in ATMs, cars, microwaves, TVs, 
        the VCR, and other home electronics. See our special-purpose computer page for further information 
        and examples.
        A specialized computer is like a general-purpose computer but is designed only to perform one or a 
        few different tasks. See our specialized computer for further information and examples of these 
        computers.
        When talking about a computer or a "PC," you're usually referring to a desktop computer found in a 
        home or office. However, the lines of what makes these computers are blurring. Below are different 
        examples of what's considered a computer today.
