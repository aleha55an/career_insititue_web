        A printer is an external hardware output device that takes the electronic data stored on a
         computer or other device and generates a hard copy. For example, if you created a report on 
         your computer, you could print several copies to hand out at a staff meeting. Printers are 
         one of the most popular computer peripherals and are commonly used to print text and photos.
          The picture is an example of an inkjet computer printer, the Lexmark Z605.

    <p class="para1">
        There are a few different ways a printer can connect to and communicate with a computer (referred 
        to as interfaces). Today, the most common connection types are by USB cable (wired) or 
        via Wi-Fi (wireless). Below is a full list of cables and interfaces used to connect a 
        computer to a printer.

    <h2 class="h3">&#x2B50;What is the most commonly used printer?:</h2>
    <p class="para2">
        The most commonly used printer can vary depending on the environment of where it's used.
         For home and family users, inkjet printers are the most commonly used because of their 
         initial price. For office environments, laser printers are the most common.

            <td>The first mechanical printer was invented by Charles Babbage, for use with the Difference 
                Engine which Babbage developed in 1822. Babbage's printer utilized metal rods with printed 
                characters on each rod to print text on rolls of paper that were fed through the device.</td>

            <td> IBM created the first dot matrix printer in 1957. However, the first dot matrix impact 
                printer was introduced by Centronics in 1970. To create letters and images, the print head,
                 which contains pins, sits over an ink ribbon. This ribbon rests above a piece of paper.
                  As the print head moves across the ribbon (usually horizontally), the pins press into the
                   ribbon to imprint ink onto the page (like a typewriter). As these pins print a series of
                    dots, you can see where this printer got its name.</td>

            <td> Inkjet printer</td>
            <td>While inkjet printers started being developed in the late 1950s, it wasn't until the 
                late 1970s that they were able to reproduce decent digital images. These higher-quality 
                inkjet printers were developed by multiple companies, including Canon, Epson, and
                 Hewlett-Packard. Inkjet printers are similar to dot matrix printers in that the images
                  they create are composed of dots. However, the dots on an inkjet printer are shot onto 
                  the page rather than using a ribbon and pins. Furthermore, an inkjet printer's dots are 
                  smaller, and their print speed is faster. See our inkjet printer page for further 
                  information about this printer.</td>

                In the early 1970s, Gary Starkweather invented the laser printer while working at Xerox by 
                modifying one of their model 7000 copiers. However, it wasn't until 1984, when Hewlett-Packard
                 introduced the HP LaserJet, that laser printers became more widely available and affordable. 
                 The following year, Apple introduced the Apple LaserWriter, which introduced PostScript
                  technology to the printer market. Laser printers are more complex than their predecessors.
                   For information on how they work, see our laser printer definition.
